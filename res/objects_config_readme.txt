The object text file includes the names & descriptions of all objects that the player can pick up in our game. This includes the 3 keys needed to progress.
The descriptions of the objects will be accessible to the player via the inventory.

1. The name of each object is listed with the description beneath. Each object & description is separated by a blank line in the config file.

2. The ID of each object is written immediately below each object's name.

Example format: 

Name:               Diary Entry #1
ID:                 Diary-1
Description:        A yellowed sheet of paper that is folded up into a rectangle. When unfolded: the left edge of the sheet is torn, suggesting it was ripped from a notebook. The paper feels soft, like it has been folded and in someone's pocket for some time. The paper is unlined. The handwriting is messy and is black ink in all caps.

                    The sound of waves again. Can't be. You're *here*: solid ground.
